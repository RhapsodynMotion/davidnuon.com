<h1>An Ode to cmd.exe<h1>


<p>You've been with me
since the past century
From 3.1 to XP, and beyond.</p>

<p>Oh, how I hate you so.
You make selecting text
so painful.</p>

<p>Your formatting,
wonky. You refuse to change
size. It's like using a concerte block.</p>

<p>Why, why cmd.exe?
You've always been with me.
I've hated you and tried to replace you.
Go away.
But you always stay.</p>

<p>Damn you, cmd.exe</p>
