            <p>I remember when I was a little tot. I drew, a lot. I never stopped drawing.
            I've always thought I was good...until I looked back at what I drew the next day.
            <strong>It sucked</strong>. That's why I went on to practice more and more.
            The same thing happened over and over again. The product didn't make me happy,
            the process did; the process of learning to improve.
            <strong>Nearly a decade later, I still think I suck,  but, hey, I'm still learning.</strong>
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>Keep on learning, never stop</strong>. We all know that person that's able to
            do anything but just stops because "it's good enough" or that he "doesn't need to do more
            that he has to." Well, I'm here to say that is the worst possible thing to you could ever
            do to yourself. It doesn't matter whether you're a developer, visual artist, chef or anything;
            just keep on getting better at what you do.</p>
            
            <p>Times change. Trends go up and down. There are new things to learn, new tools to try out,
            everything is new.<em>And are you going to allow yourself to sit through all of that?</em>
            No. You won't. You shouldn't. Embrace the new tools and make something great. Invent. Create.
            Make the world better.</p>
            
            <p>But in all of this learning, remember you're doing this to improve yourself and your craft.
            Don't get lost in the current, never forget who you are and makes your work represent you.
            <strong>Embrace your tools, never forget your fundemntals.</strong>
