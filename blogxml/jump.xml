        <p>Mutley, you snickering, floppy eared hound. When courage is needed, you're never around. 
        Those medals you wear on your moth-eaten chest should be there for bungling at which you are best. 
        So, stop that pigeon, stop that pigeon, stop that pigeon, stop that pigeon, stop that pigeon, stop 
        that pigeon, stop that pigeon. Howwww! Nab him, jab him, tab him, grab him, stop that pigeon now.</p>
        
        <p>Top Cat! The most effectual Top Cat! Who's intellectual close friends get to call him T.C., 
        providing it's with dignity. Top Cat! The indisputable leader of the gang. He's the boss, he's a pip,
        he's the championship. He's the most tip top, Top Cat.</p>
        
        <p>Ten years ago a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they 
        didn't commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. 
        Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem and no one 
        else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the A-team.</p>
        
        <p>80 days around the world, we'll find a pot of gold just sitting where the rainbow's ending. 
        Time - we'll fight against the time, and we'll fly on the white wings of the wind. 80 days around the world, 
        no we won't say a word before the ship is really back.</p>
