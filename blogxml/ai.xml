        <p>Everyone has a different definition for love;
        whether it?s the love for family, the love for friends,
        the love for pastime, or the love for that special someone.

        We all have a passion for something we love to do.
        <span>Some of us want to become doctors.</span>
        <span>Some of us want to become teachers.</span>
        <span>Some of us want to become entertainers.</span>
        <span>Some of us want to just do what we do best.</span>
        And some of us want to do something worthwhile to change the world. </p>
        
        <p>We all have a love for something we want to do.  We should never give up on our dreams and goals for life.
        We should remember our love for ourselves and what we want to do.  Keep the Hope.  Keep the Love. 
<strong>Love what you do.  Do what you love.</strong> </p>
