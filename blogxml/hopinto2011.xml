        <p>The end of the year is close. After we unwrap our Christmas gifts,
        we think about the next year. 2011 has some pretty nifty stuff going on
        in it; like running out of IPv4 addresses and starting another decade on
        the Gregorian Calendar.</p>
        
        <p>For me, it's a particularly special year. This is the year I graduate
        and advance into university. I'm not really scared at all or particularly
        worried. Finishing high school with a bang is all I'm really focusing on.</p>
        
        <p>Let's put my life aside, however. 2011 is the year of the rabbit.
        It's a time to take a breather and to make sure you work as
        efficiently as possible.</p>
        
        <p><em>Technically it starts in February, but I digress</em></p>

        <p>With that in mind, I've decided to give my site a refresh along with
        everything else that runs my life. I plan to work more but more
        importantly, <strong>work better.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Unfortunately, I can't describe every new thing is this article.
        I'll save it for later. What matters is 2011 is a year to take
        inventory and move forward. Whether it would be my ending high
        school career or your endeavors as a netizen,
        <strong>let's all hop into 2011.</strong></p>
